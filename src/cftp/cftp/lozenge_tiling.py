class LozengeTiling(MonotoneMarkovChain):
    r"""
    This class builds the "monotone" Markov chain structure on the set
    of lozenge tilings of an (a x b x c) hexagon. A tiling is represented
    by c+2 pairwise non-intersecting paths where the 0-th and (c+1)-th
    paths are fixed and are used for bounding the intermediate c paths.

    For a path system s, its k-th path s[k] starts at (k - 0.5) * dir(90),
    moves to the next vertex along (-30) or (+30) directions in each step,
    until it reaches the right vertical side of the hexagon.

    Each site has coordinates (x, y) where x is the shift along the (-30 deg)
    direction, y is the shift along the (+90 deg) direction. To find the affine
    transformation M that maps this to the cartesian coordinates, we will need

        M * (1, 0) = (sqrt(3)/2, -1/2)
        M * (0, 1) = (0, 1)

    Hence M is given by M * (x, y) = (sqrt(3)/2 * x, y - x/2)
